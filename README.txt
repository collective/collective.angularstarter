collective.angularstarter
=========================

Get started with Plone + AngularJS without any of the normal headaches associated with a manual setup.

Yeoman powered.

How it works
------------

Before installing collective.angularstarter you need to:

1 - install nodejs (suggested way NVM)
2 - npm install -g grunt-cli bower
3 - cd collective.angularstarter/collective/angularstarter/browser/angular
4 - bower install
5 - npm install

After that install the collective.angularstarter plugin and choose the more appropriate install profile:

* :default -> for production (htmlmin, image minification, concat+uglify/cssmin, uncss, cdnify)
* :devel -> suitable for development

You can extend this project and then clone it with::

    $ VENV/bin/collective_angularstarter_clone your.awesomeplugin
